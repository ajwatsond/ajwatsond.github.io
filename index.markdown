    <h3>Design Sprint 4 — Design to Extend</h3>
    <img src="/assets/images/ds4.png" alt="Design Sprint 4 thumbnail">
    <div class="muted">Revised our Knotty and Board website redesign based on external user feedback, which exposed limitations in how the digital experience supported in-store shopping. Learned how user feedback can push design beyond screens, resulting in a physical shopping cart concept that improves accessibility and ease of furniture selection.</div>
