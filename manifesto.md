## Introduction

When I first began my journey as a designer, I believed good design meant creating a polished, effective website molded precisely for a company’s needs. This belief came from observing how well-established companies had websites that simply worked, while neglected sites were often the subject of internal complaints. However, this surface-level understanding of design began to unravel during my first design sprint.

Through hands-on design work and user-centered evaluation, I realized that effective design is not about polish alone, but about understanding people—who they are, what they need, and how they interact with technology in real contexts. This shift toward human-centered thinking became the foundation for how I approached every project that followed.

## Principle 1: Design is about people, not polish

A design can appear flawless and still fail if it does not account for real users. This lesson became clear during Design Sprint 1, where my team redesigned the Knotty & Board website. Rather than designing for our own preferences, we examined who would realistically use the site—considering age, familiarity with technology, accessibility needs, and even fringe users with little online experience.

This forced me to question what “good design” actually means. Is it the most visually polished solution, or the one that accommodates the widest range of users? By prioritizing accessibility, audience expectations, and usability, I learned that design must serve people first—even when that means sacrificing aesthetic perfection.

## Principle 2: Design always shapes meaning

During Design Sprint 2, my team worked with a dataset to create both persuasive and analytical visualizations. What became immediately clear was that data is never neutral. Choices such as scale, color, and emphasis fundamentally shape how an audience interprets information.

Coming from a scientific background, I was trained to present data objectively. However, this sprint revealed that framing is unavoidable. Whether the goal is persuasion or analysis, design decisions inevitably guide attention and interpretation. This raised important questions about honesty in data visualization and reinforced the responsibility designers hold when shaping information for an audience.

## Principle 3: Experience outweighs visual perfection

In Design Sprint 3, my team created an underwater VR experience intended to immerse users in a calm, exploratory environment. Initially, I worried that the experience lacked sufficient visual polish. However, during demo day, users consistently reported feeling immersed and engaged, even with relatively simple models and textures.

This experience taught me that immersion and interaction matter more than perfection. Allowing users to control their movement and environment had a greater impact on their enjoyment than visual fidelity alone. It became clear that designers cannot fully predict user experience without feedback—testing is essential.

## Principle 4: Feedback reshapes design directions

Design Sprint 4 emphasized the power of user feedback. After receiving critiques on our initial Knotty & Board redesign, we revisited ideas we had previously dismissed. This process revealed weaknesses in our assumptions and led us to explore a radically different solution: an in-store, rideable shopping cart designed to ease furniture selection.

Feedback didn’t just improve our design—it forced us to reflect critically on our own thinking. Iteration became less about refinement and more about re-evaluation, reinforcing the importance of humility and adaptability in the design process.

## Principle 5: Design is iterative and never finished

Across all four design sprints, I learned that design is never a linear process. Each stage—research, prototyping, testing, and iteration—revealed new insights that reshaped earlier decisions. Whether refining a website, reframing data, or rethinking an immersive environment, every project demonstrated that design thrives on iteration and reflection.

## Conclusion

This course transformed my understanding of design from a focus on polish and efficiency to a deeply human-centered practice. I now view design as an evolving conversation between users, technology, and context. These principles—designing for people, shaping meaning responsibly, prioritizing experience, embracing feedback, and iterating continuously—will guide how I approach future challenges, regardless of medium or technology.
