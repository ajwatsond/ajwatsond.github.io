## Introduction — From polish to people

When I first started my journey as a designer, I believed design was about creating an effective website molded for a given company. This belief made sense to me because when I looked at the websites of large companies, I saw products that worked well and felt intuitive. In contrast, when I encountered more neglected websites, I often noticed people within those companies complaining about usability issues or workflow problems.

This belief was challenged during the first design sprint, where I realized that effective design requires a deeper understanding of the target audience. I needed to consider who users are, what they expect, and how they think when they click on a website or app—whether their goal is to complete a task, learn how to use a product, or understand what is being offered as quickly and easily as possible.

This shift away from surface-level polish toward a more human-centered design process became the foundation for how I approached later projects. It also changed how I evaluated websites and applications in my everyday life, pushing me to look beyond appearance and focus on how design decisions support real user needs.

## Principle 1: Design is about people, not polish

A design can look perfect and still fail if it does not account for real users. This idea became clear during Design Sprint 1, where I analyzed the Knotty and Board website and considered not only the customers who would actively seek it out, but also those who might encounter it incidentally.

This process forced me to think beyond my own preferences as a designer and instead consider the broader audience that might interact with the site. I began to examine factors such as age range, experience with technology, and accessibility needs. Not everyone sees, hears, or interacts with technology in the same way, and acknowledging these differences allowed me to make more informed and inclusive design decisions.

I also had to account for fringe users—those with either extensive familiarity with digital interfaces or very little experience at all. Designing for both extremes raised an important question: what truly defines good design? Is it the most visually polished solution, or the one that accommodates the widest range of users? Through this sprint, I came to understand that meaningful design prioritizes people over appearances, a realization that reshaped how I approached every project that followed.

Once I began designing for people rather than appearances, I realized that even information itself is shaped by design decisions.

## Principle 2: Design always shapes meaning

Like an artist composing a painting, the way information is framed shapes how it is perceived. This is especially evident in how we consume and interpret data. Organizations such as the American Heart Association, for example, frame health data in ways that encourage audiences to make better lifestyle choices.

As a former biologist, I was trained to present data as objectively and clearly as possible, minimizing opportunities for misinterpretation. However, during Design Sprint 2, I was tasked with using the same dataset to create both persuasive and analytical arguments. This challenge revealed how design choices—such as color, scale, and emphasis—can significantly influence interpretation.

As my group and I worked through this process, I realized that data is never neutral without framing. To communicate a point effectively, data must be shaped in a way that guides attention and understanding. This raised an important ethical question for me: what does honesty mean in data visualization? Is it presenting data in a way that supports a specific argument, or balancing clarity and persuasion without misleading the audience?

While data visualization revealed how design shapes interpretation, immersive design showed me how design shapes emotion.

## Principle 3: Experience outweighs visual perfection

When designing the VR experience, I initially wanted high visual quality so users would feel fully present in the underwater environment rather than like they were inside a rough prototype. Going into demo day, I was worried that the experience would fall short because many elements were not as polished as I had hoped.

What surprised me was that users still found the experience immersive and engaging. Several noted that with additional refinement, it could become a high-quality experience, despite its current limitations. This feedback made it clear that perfection mattered less than I expected, and that the overall experience mattered far more than visual fidelity alone.

I realized that if users have a compelling and enjoyable experience, minor imperfections are often forgiven. However, if an experience is uncomfortable or disengaging, visual polish alone cannot compensate for poor design. One of the most impactful elements was user control—allowing users to choose where they moved within the environment significantly increased their sense of immersion.

Designing for immersion made it clear that no designer fully understands the user experience alone. Feedback is essential for uncovering what truly makes an experience engaging.

## Principle 4: Feedback is a directional force, not just refinement

During Design Sprint 4, I learned that user feedback does more than improve a design—it can fundamentally change its direction. Revisiting our original Knotty and Board website redesign with feedback from outside viewers exposed gaps that were not obvious from the designer’s perspective alone.

This feedback pushed me to reconsider ideas I had initially dismissed and to critically examine assumptions I had made about how users would interact with the design. Rather than simply refining the existing solution, the feedback revealed deeper issues in how the digital experience supported in-store shopping.

As a result, the design shifted from a purely digital redesign toward a physical solution: an in-store shopping cart that allows users to move through the furniture store and select items with greater ease. This shift reinforced the importance of humility in design. Feedback is not about validating ideas, but about revealing flaws, weak points, and opportunities that only emerge when others engage with the work.

Through this process, I came to understand that meaningful iteration requires openness to change—not just in details, but in the overall direction of a solution.

## Principle 5: Design transcends modality

Across all four design sprints, the most important lesson I learned was that meaningful design principles persist regardless of medium. Whether I was working with web interfaces, data visualizations, immersive VR environments, or physical systems, the underlying design process remained consistent.

Each project required understanding users, questioning assumptions, testing ideas, and iterating based on feedback. While the tools and constraints changed dramatically between modalities, the need to prioritize human experience did not. Designing across these different contexts reinforced the idea that effective design is less about mastering a specific technology and more about applying a thoughtful, adaptable process.

This realization helped me see design as something that extends beyond individual platforms. As new technologies emerge, such as brain–computer interfaces or other unfamiliar systems, the same principles still apply: understand the user, acknowledge limitations, and remain open to change. The medium may evolve, but the responsibility to design with intention and empathy remains constant.

## Conclusion — Carrying the process forward

At the beginning of this course, I viewed design primarily as a way to create polished and functional solutions. Over the semester, that definition evolved into something far more complex and human. Through research, iteration, and reflection, I learned that design is shaped by people, experience, interpretation, and feedback—not just aesthetics or technical execution.

The principles outlined in this manifesto now guide how I approach design problems. I prioritize real users over surface-level polish, recognize the responsibility that comes with shaping meaning, value experience over perfection, and treat feedback as a catalyst for meaningful change.

Moving forward, I intend to carry this process into new domains and challenges. While the technologies I work with may change, the core of my design philosophy will remain grounded in human-centered thinking, adaptability, and critical reflection.
