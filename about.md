I’m Ajay “Jay” Watson, a computer science student with a focus on human-centered design and interaction. I’m interested in how design decisions shape the way people understand, navigate, and trust technology.

Through coursework and design sprints, I’ve worked across web design, data visualization, virtual reality, and physical interaction systems, using research and iteration to guide decisions rather than assumptions.

This portfolio reflects my approach to design: grounding ideas in real user needs, testing early, and being willing to rethink solutions when expectations don’t match reality.
